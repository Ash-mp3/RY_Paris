        <h2>Where to Eat</h2>
        <p>This is not the aspirational fluff of Instagram wall 
            neon; it's fact. Recent surveys have shown that a majority 
            of travelers consider food first when planning a trip, even 
            ahead of where they sleep. Add to this that people are also 
            traveling more than ever before - earthlings logged a 
            record-breaking 1.4 billion international trips last ear - 
            and it's safe to say that the hunger for new culinary 
            experiences is more ravenous than ever.</p>
        <p>While the endlessly alluring bistros of Paris, izakavas of 
            Tokyo, shawarma stands of Tel Aviv, and tasting menus of 
            Mexico City will always top many people's lists of cravings, 
            we're continually on the lookout for something new to fill 
            our bellies, our passports, and our feeds.</p>
