      <h2>Where to Eat</h2>
      <p>
        This is not the aspirational fluff of Instagram wall neon; it's fact.
        Recent surveys have shown that a majority of travelers consider food
        first when planning a trip, even ahead of where they sleep. Add to this
        that people are also traveling more than ever before - earthlings logged
        a record-breaking 1.4 billion international trips last ear - and it's
        safe to say that the hunger for new culinary experiences is more
        ravenous than ever.

        While the endlessly alluring bistros of Paris, izakavas of Tokyo,
        shawarma stands of Tel Aviv, and tasting menus of Mexico City will
        always top many people's lists of cravings, we're continually on the
        lookout for something new to fill our bellies, our passports, and our
        feeds.
